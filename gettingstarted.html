<h1 id="Getting Started">Getting Started</h1>

<h2 id=requirement>1. Requirement</h2>
  <p> Before you begin to use ASSIST, review the requirements given below. This may save you some
  trouble by knowing ahead of time what hardware and software you will need.
  Using ASSIST requires that you have some software packages installed and libraries. The list below
  show those required packages and libraries. Packages are usual names for the software package that
  ASSIST depends on. </p>
  <ul>
    <li>  Openjdk-6-jdk: version 6 or higher (not tested with older versions). Then you have to add the path to the libjvm.so in your LD_LIBRARY_PATH. </li>
    <li> All others libraries needed are available in the git at: git.maqao.org:S2S/LIBS.git </li>
  </ul>

<h2 id=installation>2. Installation </h2>
  <p> You can get ASSIST into two ways. First, download the binary containing MAQAO, ASSIST and all
  libraries require: </p>
  <div class="boxed">
  $git clone git@git.maqao.org:S2S/RELEASE.git
  </div>
  <p>You will get a binary and libraries, please add the folder and libraries folder in your
  LD_LIBRARY_PATH to be able to launch the “maqao” binary with the ASSIST module.
  Second, download ASSIST sources: </p>
  <div class="boxed">
  $git clone git@git.maqao.org:S2S/S2S.git
  </div>
  <p> Several libraries are required, which can be found here: </p>

  <div class="boxed">
  $git clone git@git.maqao.org:S2S/LIBS.git
  </div>
  <p> Sources have to be added as a MAQAO plugin which can be download here: </p>

  <div class="boxed">
  $git clone git@git.maqao.org:MAQAO.git
  </div>

  <p> Finally, it remains only to compile MAQAO by running the following commands from the root of the
  directory: </p>

  <div class="boxed">
  $ mkdir build <br />
  $ cd build    <br />
  $ cmake ..    <br />
  $ make –j     <br />
  </div>

<h2 id=howtouseassist> 3. How to use ASSIST </h2>
<p> In this section, it will be describe how to use the ASSIST as a MAQAO module, by giving an example and a description of different existing commands. </p>
<h3 id=annotatedsourcefile> 3.1 With annotated source file </h3>
  <p> First, applying transformations according to directives added by the user on a source file. </p>

  <code>$maqao s2s –option=”apply-directives” -src=&lt;path to file&gt;[,&lt;path to file2&gt;,...]</code>

  <p> In this case, user wants to apply all transformations according to custom directives contain in the
  source file. The option “-src” can be feed with multiple files separated by a coma. If the file to analyze
  require include files, the option “-I” take a list of paths separated by a coma. </p>

  <code>$maqao s2s –option=”apply-directives” -src=&lt;path to file&gt; -I=&lt;path to includes&gt;</code>

<h3 id=configurationfile> 3.2 With a configuration file  </h3>
  <p> Directives are not the only way to apply transformations. If a user doesn’t want to add directives
  in codes or want to apply different transformations according to the architecture, he can use a
  transformation script. A template of this file can be obtained as follow: </p>

  <code>$maqao s2s –generate-descriptor</code>

  <p> To fill this file, you should look first the documentation about it. After completing all fields, you
  can run the following command to apply transformations: </p>  

  <code>$maqao s2s -config=&lt;path to the descriptor file&gt;</code>

  <p> The transformation Script will be developed in a following section. </p>

<h3 id=profilerres> 3.3 With profilers results </h3> 
  <p> VPROF is a MAQAO module which performs a value profiling. The next command allow to apply
  the loop count transformation using VPROF’s results contains in the “res.csv” file. To use VPROF’s
  results, the user must use the “-bin” option with the binary use for the VPROF analyze. If a file cannot
  be analyzing, the user can exclude this one with the option “–E”. </p>

  <code>$maqao s2s –bin=&lt;binary&gt; -vprof_xp=&lt;res.csv&gt; -E=&lt;file to exclude&gt;[,&lt;file2&gt;,...]</code>

  <p> An alternative to use VPROF’s results without to indicate the binary is to use the results file
  return by ONEVIEW. ONEVIEW is also a MAQAO module which can launch different MAQAO modules
  automatically. To obtain VPROF results you have to use the report two of ONEVIEW and add the
  option “--assist”, it will create an “assist.lua” file. </p>

  <code>$maqao s2s -oneview=&lt;assist.lua&gt;</code>

  <p> Another MAQAO’s module is CQA, a static analyzer which can return, along with other metrics,
  the vectorization ratio of a target basic block. </p>

  <code>$maqao s2s –cqa_xp=&lt;res.csv&gt;</code>

  <p> In addition of metrics, information in the CSV file return by CQA already contains where are
  source files and loops to handle, so it’s not useful to add the “-src=” option. This command will
  automatically apply the block vectorization on loops with a poor vectorization ratio (see section 3.1.5
  to more information about the block vectorization). </p>

<h2 id=assisthelp> 4. ASSIST Help </h2>
<!-- <p> As see in the previous section our tool can get multiple options. -->
<pre>
$maqao s2s --help
 In this section, we will describe all options, but you can found theses information in the help of the module. </p>

</pre>

<h2 id=configfile> 5. Configuration File </h2> 
ASSIST can take as input a configuration file which contains all information to transform a specific file; it is
composed as follow:

<pre>
File=”&lt;path/to/the/src/file&gt;”
Arch= {
  All = {
    Loops = {
      {line = &lt;line&gt;, transformation = {“&lt;trans&gt;”}},
      {line = &lt;line&gt;, transformation = {“&lt;othertrans&gt;”}},
      {label = ”&lt;label&gt;”, transformation = {“&lt;trans&gt;”}
    }
    Functions = {
      {line = <line>, transformation={“<trans1>”,”<trans2>”,...},
      ...
    }
  x86 = {
    ...
  }
}
</pre>
<ul>
  <li>“File” contains the complete path to the file or at least the path from where you execute ASSIST to the file.</li>
  <li>“Arch” contains all architecture you want to handle. You can name all arch field as you want, you just have to call with the option “—arch=&lt;archName&gt;” to apply transformation contains in the field of your defined arch. By default “All” will be call, therefore, it is advisable to have it defined.</li>
  <li>In all architectures we can find two fields: “Loops” and “Functions”, which respectively represent all loops and functions in the file.
  They will be defined by their line (or a label) and transformations to apply. If they are multiple transformations to apply it is possible to separate them by a coma. Transformations will be applied in the order, from left to right. Each statement to handle can be located by to ways. 
  First, their line, it is corresponding to the line where the statement begins. Second, it is possible to add a label above the statement to locate it. 
  This label must be defines as a directive (or pragmas according to the language used) and look like:
<code>!DIR$ MAQAO &lt;label&gt;</code> or <code>#pragma MAQAO &lt;label&gt;</code>. &lt;label&gt; must be a string and must correspond exactly to the label in the configuration file, no substring is allowed.
&lt;trans&gt; is a string which represent the transformation to apply. Available values are the same as for directives: <code>!DIR$(/#pragma) MAQAO &lt;trans&gt;</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id=transformations>6. Transformations</h2>
This section presents the different transformations available and an example of how to transform source code with the associate directives. Each directive is composed as follow: “!DIR$ MAQAO ” or “#pragma MAQAO” followed by the transformation of your choice.
<h3 id=transloops>6.1 Loops</h3>
This section presents all directives available for loops (Fortran do loop and C/C++ for).
<h4 id=transunroll> 6.1.1 Unroll </h4>
The unrolling transformation replicate the body of a loop a certain number of times; this
number is called the unrolling factor. The unrolling can improve the performance by reducing loop
overhead. The directive for this transformation is: <code>!DIR$ MAQAO UNROLL=value</code>.
<div id="sides">
  <div id=left>
    <pre>
      Before:
        do i = 1, x
          !DIR$ MAQAO UNROLL=4
          do j =1, N, 1
            a[j] = b[i] + c[j]
          enddo
        enddo  


    </pre>
  </div>
  <div id=right>
    <pre>
    After:
      do i = 1, x
        do j =1, N-3, 4
          a[j] = b[i] + c[j]
          a[j] = b[i+1] + c[j]
          a[j] = b[i+2] + c[j]
          a[j] = b[i+3] + c[j]
        enddo
      enddo
    </pre>
  </div>

<h4 id=transfullunroll>6.1.2  Full Unroll </h4>
This transformation is the same as previously but the loop is replaced by its unrolled body.
The directive for this transformation is: “!DIR$ MAQAO FULLUNROLL[=N]”. An unroll factor can be
define if bounds were not set.
<div id="sides">
  <div id=left>
    <pre>
      Before:
        do i = 1, x
          !DIR$ MAQAO FULLUNROLL
          do j =1, 7, 1
            a[j] = b[i] + c[j]
          enddo
        enddo

        a[3] = b[i] + c[3]
        a[4] = b[i] + c[4]
        a[5] = b[i] + c[5]
        a[6] = b[i] + c[6]

<h4>6.1.3  Tile </h4>
Tiling (or Blocking) consists to divide an iteration space into tiles and transforming the loop
nest to iterate over them. Two possibilities of tiling are available, the first one is to tile the whole
loop nest under the directive. The directive for this transformation is: <code>!DIR$ MAQAO TILE=N</code>, when
n is the value of the tile.
<div id="sides">
  <div id=left>
    <pre>
      Before:
        !DIR$ MAQAO TILE=8
        do x = 1, N, 1
          do y = 1, M, 1
            &lt;loop body&gt;
          enddo
        enddo 



    </pre>
  </div>
  <div id=right>
    <pre>
    After:
      do lt_var_x = 1, N, 8
        do x = lt_var_x, min(N,lt_var_x+8), 1
          do lt_var_y = 1, M, 8
            do y = lt_var_y, min(M,lt_var_y+7), 1
              &lt;loop body&gt;
            enddo
          enddo
        enddo
      enddo
    </pre>
  </div>

<br/>
The second version is a variant of the tiling, the strip mining. 
It is a method to adjust the granularity of an operation. The strip mining transforms a singly nested loop (the inner) into a doubly nested one. 
The directive for this transformation is: <code>!DIR$ MAQAO TILE_INNER=N</code>, when N is the value of the strip. The next example illustrates the strip mining transformation
<div id="sides">
  <div id=left>
    <pre>
      Before:
        !DIR$ MAQAO TILE_INNER=8

          do k = 1, M, 1
            &lt;loop body&gt;
          enddo
        enddo

      lt_bound_M = (M /8)*8
      do lt_var_k = 1, lt_boutnd_M, 8
        do t = 1, N, 1
          do y = lt_var_k, lt_var_k+8, 1
            &lt;loop body&gt;
          enddo
        enddo
      enddo
      if (lt_bound_M < M) then
        do t = 1, N, 1
          do y = lt_bound_M+1, M, 1
            &lt;loop body&gt;
          enddo
        enddo
      endif
    </pre>

<h4 id=translct>6.1.4 Loop Count</h4>
<p>The loop count transformation consists in informing the compiler of the iterations to be expected for a loop by using a directive: loop count (min, max, avg). 
This is important given that many loops have bounds that are set with variables and only known to the compiler at runtime. 
The compiler attempts to determine the number of iterations for a loop and the work within that loop to determine if vectorizing the loop is "profitable". 
This information can be exploited by Intel compilers; by default the compiler will generate multiple variants (e.g. scalar, SSE, AVX, etc.) of the same source loop at the binary level, with the loop count directive it will generate much less variants. 
Helping in such a manner the compiler throughout the whole application can provide a significant performance gain.<br/>
This transformation uses results from a dynamic analysis of the MAQAO values profiler VPROF.
This module can, among other things, count the minimal, maximal and average number of iteration of a loop. 
From the VPROF’s output (a csv file), ASSIST can automatically add to all hotspots analyzed by VPROF the loop count directive. 
This feedback directed optimization avoids a time consuming and prone-error task and in general achieve good results.
</p>
<h4>6.1.5  Short Vectorization </h4>
<p>We noticed in some occasions that even when the loop bound was hard-coded the compiler would not vectorize properly that loop. 
We can check such cases thanks the MAQAO module CQA which provides us with vectorization metrics. 
This transformation performs the following steps on a given loop:</p>
<ul>
<li> Force the compiler to vectorize the loop using SIMD directive</li>
<li> Prevent generating peeling code using vector unaligned directive</li>
<li> Adapt the number of iterations to the vector length </li>
</ul>

<h4>6.1.6  Generic Short Vectorization </h4>
<p>Short Vectorization can be applying even if the loop bounds are not known. 
This generic version check rest of the modulo of the loop’s bound and apply the block vectorization on each generated version.</p>

<h3 id=transfunc>6.2 Functions</h3>
<p>This section shows all transformations available for functions and how to procced to apply each one
with directives.</p>

<h4>6.2.1 Partial Dead Code Elimination </h4>
<p>The dead code elimination works as follow: 
In our detection algorithm, we search if conditions are always (/never) true or false. 
Currently, it is only available with Integers or for some cases with variables. 
If a variable is in the expression to evaluate, we are looking for the last assignment of this variable. 
If it is an Integer and if this assignment is not in a conditional or in a loop, we consider the value instead of the variable to evaluate the expression (See example below).
In the next example we can see that two transformations were applied. 
The first was on statement (1): its conditional will always be false and only the else part of this statement will be executed, therefore we replace the whole statement by the “else” body. 
A second elimination was applied, on statement (2): we can observe that the loop “do j=k, 99,1” will never be execute due to k’s value (100). 
Therefore, we delete the statement which makes the loop above empty, which leads to its deletion making the “true” body of the “if” statement empty. 
To avoid to have empty body we invert the conditional with a NOT and move the “else” body into the “if” body.

  Example of the partial dead code elimination transformation
</div>
<br/>
<p>Actuals compilers do the same work and more, but this transformation is the first of a series of optimizations working on functions like the function specialization.</p>

<h4 id=transfuncspe>6.2.2 Function Specialization</h4>
<p>For a specific run it is possible than a function will always be called with an idempotent parameter, or if the user know bounds of a parameter (also available for a variable in the body of the function), so this transformation create a copy of the function removing all dead code implies by the information in the directive. 
There is a variant of this directive where the “if then CALL func_spe else...” was not create, the directive for that is: <code>!DIR$ MAQAO SPECIALIZE_WITHOUT_CALL(&lt;info&gt;)</code>.
The figure 6 and7 show the specialization function, before and after transformation. 
The loop (1) was remove because the condition of the “if” statement (2) was detected as always false and therefore the loop become empty. 
The same applies for the “if” statement (3), the user indicate than the variable “k” will be less or equals to10, the “else” (4) part will always the chosen path, so the “if” statement was replaced by the else body. 
As show on figure 6, the user can give multiple indications about a variable. 
The user can seta value to the variable by the operator “=”; he can also give bounds, with operators “&lt;”, “&gt;”, the value will not be including; finally he can indicate a set of value with operator “={val1,val2}”, in this case the variable values can only be between “val1” and “val2” including.

<h2 id=mixtrans>7.  How to mix transformations </h2>
Some transformations can be coupled to increase the scope of possibilities. Currently, only
the specialization can be coupled with other transformations, but in the future, we may add the
possibility of coupling other transformations. To apply a transformation on a specialized version the
directive has to start by “IF_SPE_” followed by a string composed of the variable name, a letter
representing the comparator: “e” for “ =”; s for “>”; “I” for “<”; “b” for “{ , }”, and the value. This
sequence is the same as how specialized function name are build.

  Example of specialization coupled with the unroll transformation

<br/>
As we can see, the loop has been specialized two times; one with x equals to 8 and the second with k
equals to 1. The unroll transformation has been only applied on the specialized version with x equals
to 8.

<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id=limitations> 9. Caveats &and; Limitations</h2>
Some limitations have been presented in the previous section and what we did to improve them but Rose being a research project and ASSIST being a prototype, there is still room for improvements. 
This chapter will list most of these caveats and limitations.

<h3>9.1 Fortran Intrinsic modules</h3>
Fortran has some specials intrinsic modules (e.g. ISO_FORTRAN_ENV, OMP_LIB,
OMP_LIB_KINDS, ISO_C_BINDING, IEEE_EXCEPTIONS, IEEE_ARITHMETIC, IEEE_FEATURES) which are
not handle by Rose.

<h3>9.2 Preprocessor</h3>
First, we will talk about preprocessors directives. We must differentiate two cases: the first
one is for preprocessor statement in Fortran; they are not well managed by Rose. The Fortran
Frontend in Rose is a not well-tested frontend and it is not intended to take account directives type
C. As see in the example, files have to be preprocessed before transformations.
The second case is for C/C++; Rose was designed as a compiler so it needs to know if the body of a
“#ifdef” statement will be use (or not). If we analyze the body of the “#ifdef” statement, we will not
analyze the “#else” part (and vice versa). We worked to restore all the elements of each part of the
directive in the output file, but the user will be able to modify only one part at time.

<h3>9.3 Languages</h3>
The Rose frontend is the OpenFortranParser, a Java parser for Fortran. We modified many
things in Rose to better handle Fortran statements, but we did not add the management of all
keywords and new statements available in Fortran2008 du to the amount of work that is involved.
The file to transform has to be included between Fortran77 and Fortran2003. We have the same kind
of problem in C++, Rose’s frontend only handle C++ up to C++03.

<h2 id=faq>10. F.A.Q </h2>
During the execution of ASSIST, the source file that you want to transform can generate some
errors, in fact, the Rose Project has not well tested for Fortran, we modified it as we can to handle a
maximum of cases, but it’s possible we forgot some of them.
This section tries to help you with classical errors.
<ul>
  <li>What if my code generates a message and crash: “File rmodFileName = &lt;module&gt;.rmod
NOT FOUND (expected to be present) error: No declaration found for the module:
&lt;modulename&gt;” ?</li>
 
You probably not generate the rmod file which corresponding to the module you want to use.
Use the option presented previously in the document: “-generateAllRMOD=<path_to_src>” or
you can generate a RMOD file from a unique source file with the next command:
$maqao s2s -option=”generateRMOD” -src=<path_to_file>
The first one will generate a RMOD file by module contains in your folder, and the second will do
the same but for one file.

<li>  I created rmod files but a message report that it does not find it ?</li>

Please use the “-I” option during the call of the maqao module:
$maqao s2s -I=&lt;path_to_rmod_files_and_includes&gt;,&lt;second_path&gt;,...

<li>What can I do something goes wrong in another file that I am transforming ?</li>

If a message indicate something goes wrong in another file, please check the RMOD file and remove or comment the bug part (if it not impact your file).
You have to know that Rose was designed for gcc4.4 (and gfortran4.4) and it's possible to not known some new rules. 
If you do not be able to modify the rmod file or if it's not enough please contact us.
If your file contain some C++11 statement, we cannot handle it because of the Rose C++ frontends.

<li>  Why my file cannot be transformed ? </li>

If your Fortran file return you a error message, before anything please check if your file has not .f08 as extension (not able yet). 
Then check if the extension do not contain any maj like .F90 (we do not really known why but we work on it), in this case transform the extension file into .f90.
Finally, if it is Fortran2008, checks if it not contains any fortran2008 feature (as the “contiguous” keyword, for example) and rename the extension as .f03.

<li> I want to transform c files but it does not find standard headers? </li>
It is possible that Rose did not find standard headers. Please use the “-I” option during the call of
the MAQAO module to gcc/g++ headers (path can be found by locating the file “stddef.h”) as the
follow example:
<code>$maqao s2s -I=/usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/4.4/include/</code>
