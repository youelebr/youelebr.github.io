<h1 id="Getting Started">Getting Started</h1>

<h2 id=requirement>1. Requirement</h2>
  <p> Before you begin to use ASSIST, review the requirements given below. This may save you some
  trouble by knowing ahead of time what hardware and software you will need.
  Using ASSIST requires that you have some software packages installed and libraries. The list below
  show those required packages and libraries. Packages are usual names for the software package that
  ASSIST depends on. </p>
  <ul>
    <li>  Openjdk-6-jdk: version 6 or higher (not tested with older versions). Then you have to add the path to the libjvm.so in your LD_LIBRARY_PATH. </li>
    <li> All others libraries needed are available in the git at: git.maqao.org:S2S/LIBS.git </li>
  </ul>

<h2 id=installation>2. Installation </h2>
  <p> You can get ASSIST into two ways. First, download the binary containing MAQAO, ASSIST and all
  libraries require: </p>
  <div class="boxed">
  $git clone git@git.maqao.org:S2S/RELEASE.git
  </div>
  <p>You will get a binary and libraries, please add the folder and libraries folder in your
  LD_LIBRARY_PATH to be able to launch the “maqao” binary with the ASSIST module.
  Second, download ASSIST sources: </p>
  <div class="boxed">
  $git clone git@git.maqao.org:S2S/S2S.git
  </div>
  <p> Several libraries are required, which can be found here: </p>

  <div class="boxed">
  $git clone git@git.maqao.org:S2S/LIBS.git
  </div>
  <p> Sources have to be added as a MAQAO plugin which can be download here: </p>

  <div class="boxed">
  $git clone git@git.maqao.org:MAQAO.git
  </div>

  <p> Finally, it remains only to compile MAQAO by running the following commands from the root of the
  directory: </p>

  <div class="boxed">
  $ mkdir build <br />
  $ cd build    <br />
  $ cmake ..    <br />
  $ make –j     <br />
  </div>

<h2 id=howtouseassist> 3. How to use ASSIST </h2>
<p> In this section, it will be describe how to use the ASSIST as a MAQAO module, by giving an example and a description of different existing commands. </p>
<h3 id=annotatedsourcefile> 3.1 With annotated source file </h3>
  <p> First, applying transformations according to directives added by the user on a source file. </p>

  <code>$maqao s2s –option=”apply-directives” -src=&lt;path to file&gt;[,&lt;path to file2&gt;,...]</code>

  <p> In this case, user wants to apply all transformations according to custom directives contain in the
  source file. The option “-src” can be feed with multiple files separated by a coma. If the file to analyze
  require include files, the option “-I” take a list of paths separated by a coma. </p>

  <code>$maqao s2s –option=”apply-directives” -src=&lt;path to file&gt; -I=&lt;path to includes&gt;</code>

<h3 id=configurationfile> 3.2 With a configuration file  </h3>
  <p> Directives are not the only way to apply transformations. If a user doesn’t want to add directives
  in codes or want to apply different transformations according to the architecture, he can use a
  transformation script. A template of this file can be obtained as follow: </p>

  <code>$maqao s2s –generate-descriptor</code>

  <p> To fill this file, you should look first the documentation about it. After completing all fields, you
  can run the following command to apply transformations: </p>  

  <code>$maqao s2s -config=&lt;path to the descriptor file&gt;</code>

  <p> The transformation Script will be developed in a following section. </p>

<h3 id=profilerres> 3.3 With profilers results </h3> 
  <p> VPROF is a MAQAO module which performs a value profiling. The next command allow to apply
  the loop count transformation using VPROF’s results contains in the “res.csv” file. To use VPROF’s
  results, the user must use the “-bin” option with the binary use for the VPROF analyze. If a file cannot
  be analyzing, the user can exclude this one with the option “–E”. </p>

  <code>$maqao s2s –bin=&lt;binary&gt; -vprof_xp=&lt;res.csv&gt; -E=&lt;file to exclude&gt;[,&lt;file2&gt;,...]</code>

  <p> An alternative to use VPROF’s results without to indicate the binary is to use the results file
  return by ONEVIEW. ONEVIEW is also a MAQAO module which can launch different MAQAO modules
  automatically. To obtain VPROF results you have to use the report two of ONEVIEW and add the
  option “--assist”, it will create an “assist.lua” file. </p>

  <code>$maqao s2s -oneview=&lt;assist.lua&gt;</code>

  <p> Another MAQAO’s module is CQA, a static analyzer which can return, along with other metrics,
  the vectorization ratio of a target basic block. </p>

  <code>$maqao s2s –cqa_xp=&lt;res.csv&gt;</code>

  <p> In addition of metrics, information in the CSV file return by CQA already contains where are
  source files and loops to handle, so it’s not useful to add the “-src=” option. This command will
  automatically apply the block vectorization on loops with a poor vectorization ratio (see section 3.1.5
  to more information about the block vectorization). </p>

<h2 id=assisthelp> 4. ASSIST Help </h2>
<!-- <p> As see in the previous section our tool can get multiple options. -->
<pre>
$maqao s2s --help
 In this section, we will describe all options, but you can found theses information in the help of the module. </p>

</pre>

<h2 id=configfile> 5. Configuration File </h2> 
ASSIST can take as input a configuration file which contains all information to transform a specific file; it is
composed as follow:

<pre>
File=”&lt;path/to/the/src/file&gt;”
Arch= {
  All = {
    Loops = {
      {line = &lt;line&gt;, transformation = {“&lt;trans&gt;”}},
      {line = &lt;line&gt;, transformation = {“&lt;othertrans&gt;”}},
      {label = ”&lt;label&gt;”, transformation = {“&lt;trans&gt;”}
    }
    Functions = {
      {line = <line>, transformation={“<trans1>”,”<trans2>”,...},
      ...
    }
  x86 = {
    ...
  }
}
</pre>
<ul>
  <li>“File” contains the complete path to the file or at least the path from where you execute ASSIST to the file.</li>
  <li>“Arch” contains all architecture you want to handle. You can name all arch field as you want, you just have to call with the option “—arch=&lt;archName&gt;” to apply transformation contains in the field of your defined arch. By default “All” will be call, therefore, it is advisable to have it defined.</li>
  <li>In all architectures we can find two fields: “Loops” and “Functions”, which respectively represent all loops and functions in the file.
  They will be defined by their line (or a label) and transformations to apply. If they are multiple transformations to apply it is possible to separate them by a coma. Transformations will be applied in the order, from left to right. Each statement to handle can be located by to ways. 
  First, their line, it is corresponding to the line where the statement begins. Second, it is possible to add a label above the statement to locate it. 
  This label must be defines as a directive (or pragmas according to the language used) and look like:
<code>!DIR$ MAQAO &lt;label&gt;</code> or <code>#pragma MAQAO &lt;label&gt;</code>. &lt;label&gt; must be a string and must correspond exactly to the label in the configuration file, no substring is allowed.
&lt;trans&gt; is a string which represent the transformation to apply. Available values are the same as for directives: <code>!DIR$(/#pragma) MAQAO &lt;trans&gt;</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id=transformations>6. Transformations</h2>
This section presents the different transformations available and an example of how to transform source code with the associate directives. Each directive is composed as follow: “!DIR$ MAQAO ” or “#pragma MAQAO” followed by the transformation of your choice.
<h3 id=transloops>6.1 Loops</h3>
This section presents all directives available for loops (Fortran do loop and C/C++ for).
<h4 id=transunroll> 6.1.1 Unroll </h4>
The unrolling transformation replicate the body of a loop a certain number of times; this
number is called the unrolling factor. The unrolling can improve the performance by reducing loop
overhead. The directive for this transformation is: <code>!DIR$ MAQAO UNROLL=value</code>.
<div id="sides">
  <div id=left>
    <pre>
    Before:
      Do i = 1, x
        !DIR$ MAQAO UNROLL=4
        Do j =1, N, 1
          A[j] = b[i] + c[j]
        enddo
      enddo  


    </pre>
  </div>
  <div id=right>
    <pre>
    After:
      Do i = 1, x
        Do j =1, N-3, 4
          A[j] = b[i] + c[j]
          A[j] = b[i+1] + c[j]
          A[j] = b[i+2] + c[j]
          A[j] = b[i+3] + c[j]
        enddo
      enddo
    </pre>
  </div>

<br/>

<h4 id=transfullunroll>6.1.2  Full Unroll </h4>
This transformation is the same as previously but the loop is replaced by its unrolled body.
The directive for this transformation is: “!DIR$ MAQAO FULLUNROLL[=N]”. An unroll factor can be
define if bounds were not set.
<div id="sides">
  <div id=left>
    <pre>
      Before:
        Do i = 1, x
          !DIR$ MAQAO FULLUNROLL
          Do j =1, 7, 1
            A[j] = b[i] + c[j]
          enddo
        enddo

      Do i = 1, x
        A[1] = b[i] + c[1]
        A[2] = b[i] + c[2]
        A[3] = b[i] + c[3]
        A[4] = b[i] + c[4]
        A[5] = b[i] + c[5]
        A[6] = b[i] + c[6]
        A[7] = b[i] + c[7]

<h4>6.1.3  Tile </h4>
Tiling (or Blocking) consists to divide an iteration space into tiles and transforming the loop
nest to iterate over them. Two possibilities of tiling are available, the first one is to tile the whole
loop nest under the directive. The directive for this transformation is: <code>!DIR$ MAQAO TILE=N</code>, when
n is the value of the tile.
<div id="sides">
  <div id=left>
    <pre>
      Before:
        !DIR$ MAQAO TILE=8
        Do x = 1, N, 1
          Do y = 1, M, 1
            &lt;loop body&gt;
          end do
        end do 



    </pre>
  </div>
  <div id=right>
    <pre>
    After:
      do lt_var_x = 1, N, 8
        do x = lt_var_x, min(N,lt_var_x+8), 1
          do lt_var_y = 1, M, 8
            do y = lt_var_y, min(M,lt_var_y+7), 1
              &lt;loop body&gt;
            end do
          end do
        end do
      end do
    </pre>
  </div>

</div>
<br/>
The second version is a variant of the tiling, the strip mining. 
It is a method to adjust the granularity of an operation. The strip mining transforms a singly nested loop (the inner) into a doubly nested one. 
The directive for this transformation is: <code>!DIR$ MAQAO TILE_INNER=N</code>, when N is the value of the strip. The next example illustrates the strip mining transformation
<div id="sides">
  <div id=left>
    <pre>
      Before:
        !DIR$ MAQAO TILE_INNER=8
        Do t = 1, N, 1
          Do k = 1, M, 1
            &lt;loop body&gt;
          end do
        end do 









    </pre>
  </div>
  <div id=right>
    <pre>
    After:
      lt_bound_M = (M /8)*8
      do lt_var_k = 1, lt_boutnd_M, 8
        do t = 1, N, 1
          do y = lt_var_k, lt_var_k+8, 1
            &lt;loop body&gt;
          end do
        end do
      end do
      if (lt_bound_M < M) then
        do t = 1, N, 1
          do y = lt_bound_M+1, M, 1
            &lt;loop body&gt;
          end do
        end do
      end if

<h4 id=translct>6.1.4 Loop Count</h4>
The loop count transformation consists in informing the compiler of the iterations to be
expected for a loop by using a directive: loop count (min, max, avg). This is important given that
many loops have bounds that are set with variables and only known to the compiler at runtime. The
compiler attempts to determine the number of iterations for a loop and the work within that loop to
determine if vectorizing the loop is "profitable". This information can be exploited by Intel compilers;
by default the compiler will generate multiple variants (e.g. scalar, SSE, AVX, etc.) of the same source
loop at the binary level, with the loop count directive it will generate much less variants. Helping in
such a manner the compiler throughout the whole application can provide a significant performance
gain.<br/>
This transformation uses results from a dynamic analysis of the MAQAO values profiler VPROF.
This module can, among other things, count the minimal, maximal and average number of iteration
of a loop. From the VPROF’s output (a csv file), ASSIST can automatically add to all hotspots analyzed
by VPROF the loop count directive. This feedback directed optimization avoids a time consuming and
prone-error task and in general achieve good results.

<h4>6.1.5  Block Vectorization </h4>
We noticed in some occasions that even when the loop bound was hard-coded the compiler
would not vectorize properly that loop. We can check such cases thanks the MAQAO module CQA
which provides us with vectorization metrics. This transformation performs the following steps on a
given loop:
<ul>
<li> Force the compiler to vectorize the loop using SIMD directive</li>
<li> Prevent generating peeling code using vector unaligned directive</li>
<li> Adapt the number of iterations to the vector length </li>
</ul>

<h4>6.1.6  Generic Block Vectorization </h4>
Block Vectorization can be applying even if loop’s bounds are not known. This generic version
check rest of the modulo of the loop’s bound and apply the block vectorization on each generated
version.
